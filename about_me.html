            <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
                Hi there! I'm Darius 龍偉亮, and I'm from Malaysia. My mother tongue is Chinese, but growing up in an environment where English is commonly used, it has naturally become my second native language.
                <br><br>
                In 2020, I moved to Taiwan to pursue my passion for computers—something that has fascinated me since childhood. My curiosity for technology led me to experiment early on, from exploring Windows Insider builds to flashing custom kernels on my phone and customizing systems to my liking. These experiences sparked the little engineer in me and shaped my interest in IT.
                <br><br>
                Beyond academics, I’ve had the privilege of leading fire and LED poi performances, captaining badminton teams in multiple competitions, and organizing various club-based events. These experiences have honed my leadership, teamwork, and event management skills, while also fostering self-discipline and adaptability.
            </p>
